    "Here, you'll get a chance to try camera calibration and distortion correction for yourself!  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main steps to this process: use chessboard images to obtain image points and object points, and then use the OpenCV functions `cv2.calibrateCamera()` and `cv2.undistort()` to compute the calibration and undistortion.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, we can't perform the extraction of object points and image points in the browser quiz editor, so we provide these for you in the quiz below.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Try computing the calibration and undistortion in the exercise below, and if you want to play with extracting object points and image points yourself, fork the Jupyter notebook and images in [this repository](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Camera-Calibration). You can also download the [distortion pickle file](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/files/Advanced_Lane_Finding_Images/correct_for_distortion/wide_dist_pickle.p) and [test image](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/files/Advanced_Lane_Finding_Images/correct_for_distortion/test_image.png) used in the below quiz if you'd like to run the below code on your own machine.\n",

Stochastic gradient descent is used as an iterative optimisation technique for solving the [maximum likelihood estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation) problem when a closed-form solution does not exist (as in logistic regression). In essence, SGD iteratively estimates the parameters of a discrete probability distribution given a set of input observations. _Stochastic_ here implies that a batch size of $1$ is used. That is, on every weight update step only a single training example is used to compute the gradients. This differs from _batch_ or _mini-batch_ gradient descent, which use the full, or subset of the full datasets, on each update step.\n",

        "We will use the TensorFlow built-in [`tf.Variable`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Variable?hl=en) tensor object to distinguish our trainable model parameters (weight, bias vectors) from otherwise static tensor objects. These `tf.Variable` objects maintain a shared, persistent state and therefore come with a few useful operations (e.g., [`assign_sub()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Variable#assign_sub) method) that we will use during training to manipulate their values. Another nice feature of the `tf.Variable` is that they are automatically traced and watched during the `tf.GradientTape` steps."

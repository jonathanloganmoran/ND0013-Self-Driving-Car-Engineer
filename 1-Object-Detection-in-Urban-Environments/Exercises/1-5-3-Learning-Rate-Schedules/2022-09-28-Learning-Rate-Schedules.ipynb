        "In machine learning and statistics, the [learning rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_rate) is a tunable hyperparameter in an optimisation algorithm that determines the step size at each iteration while moving towards a minimum of a loss function (credit: Wikipedia). Setting learning rates optimally is often a balancing act between over- and overshooting a global minima. When the learning rate is _too low_, a model might fail to converge as its steps in the direction of a function minima are simply too small. On the other hand, a learning rate that is _too high_ might result in extremely large steps that _overshoot_ the function minima and miss the target entirely. An optimal (fixed) learning rate value should be selected such that the likelihood of overshooting is minimised and that is sufficiently large to perform steepest descent towards convergence.\n",

        "A [learning rate schedule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_rate#Learning_rate_schedule) helps accomplish this by not only decreasing overshoot but also speeding up the time it could take to reach convergence. LR schedules have two important properties: _decay_ and _momentum_. Decay is a hyperparameter that controls overshooting by decreasing (_annealing_) the learning rate by a fixed factor. Momentum is another hyperparameter that helps us speed up the convergence time. Analogous to a ball rolling down a hill; momentum governs how quickly our learning rate decays. This is extremely useful for making sure that the direction we move in towards steepest descent is indeed towards the global minima and not just towards a local minimum (as a ball with little to no momentum will struggle to 'get over' the shallow [saddle points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle_point) of the differentiable function."

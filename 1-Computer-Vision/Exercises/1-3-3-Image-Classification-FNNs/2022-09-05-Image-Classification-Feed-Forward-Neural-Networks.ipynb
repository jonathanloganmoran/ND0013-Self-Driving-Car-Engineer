The output layer was computed directly from the sum of the product of the input layer units and the perceptron weights (plus a bias term). The output of the single-layer perceptron was then passed into an activation function (the softmax function), and a classification label was selected by choosing the prediction with the highest probability value."

    "\n",
    "[Multi-layer perceptrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network#Multi-layer_perceptron) (MLPs) are a type of Feedforward Neural Network composed of many single-layer perceptrons. These perceptrons are organised into groups called _layers_. In a MLP, we introduce at least one _hidden_ layer composed of multiple perceptrons. These perceptrons in a hidden layer are not interconnected (i.e., no connections between each other in the same layer) but are said to be \"fully connected\" to the perceptrons in a preceding layer. In a hidden layer, these perceptrons also have activation functions, similar to the output layer in a single-layer perceptron.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like single-layer perceptrons, multi-layer perceptrons are trained by iteratively updating the weights and bias values in order to minimise an error (cost) function. Using _stochastic gradient descent_ to adjust these model parameters, we saw in Exercise 1.3.2 that, after a given number of epochs (passes) over our entire dataset, we were able to settle on semi-optimal weight $\\mathrm{w}$ and bias $\\mathrm{b}$ values.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can break the training phase into two primary steps with the multi-layer perceptron: a _forward pass_ and a _backwards_ pass. With a _forward_ pass over the data, each layer of perceptrons calculates a sum of products between the perceptron weights and the input values. The resulting values are then passed to an activation function (such as the _Rectified Linear Unit_ — [ReLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks))) where a single output value is generated. In a _backwards_ pass over over the network, we update the model parameters (the weights and bias values) using the partial derivative of an error function (like [cross-entropy loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_entropy#Cross-entropy_loss_function_and_logistic_regression)). With the backpropagation algorithm, values calculated in the forward pass are used to compute the gradients for each of the model parameters. The \"backwards\" pass here indicates that the gradients are propagated back through the network starting from the output nodes to the nodes in the first hidden layer. The partial computations at each layer are used to update the weight values at each step."

While some callback functionality is baked in by default (e.g., [`callbacks.History`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/History)), several other popular callbacks exist. One of those is the [`callbacks.LearningRateScheduler`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/LearningRateScheduler) which serves as a base class for all custom learning rate schedulers (e.g., [`optimizers.schedules.ExponentialDecay`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/LearningRateScheduler)).

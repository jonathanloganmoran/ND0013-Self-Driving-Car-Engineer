### Contents
The following topics are covered in course projects:

##### Course 1: Computer Vision
* Training a SSD object detection model on the Waymo Open Dataset in TensorFlow
* Fine-tuning strategies and making architectural optimisations for DNNs
* Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and training / evaluation error analysis
* And so much more ... (see [1-Computer-Vision](https://github.com/jonathanloganmoran/ND0013-Self-Driving-Car-Engineer/tree/main/1-Computer-Vision) for full list of course topics).
